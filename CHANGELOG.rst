2.0.0 (12 December 2020)
------------------------

* There is a new ``footcite`` role and a new ``footbibliography``
  directive, to allow easy and simple local (per document)
  bibliographies through footnotes.
  See issues #184 and #185.

* Parallel builds are now finally supported.
  See issues #80, #96, and #164, as well as pull request #210.

* **BACKWARD INCOMPATIBLE**
  To enable parallel builds, a new mandatory
  config setting ``bibtex_bibfiles`` has been added. This setting
  specifies all bib files used throughout the project,
  relative to the source folder.

* **BACKWARD INCOMPATIBLE**
  The encoding of bib files has been moved to an optional
  config setting ``bibtex_encoding``. The ``:encoding:``
  option is no longer supported.

* Headers for ``bibliography`` and ``footbibliography`` directives
  can be configured via the ``bibtex_bibliography_header`` and
  ``bibtex_footbibliography_header`` config setting.

* The ``bibliography`` directive no longer requires the bib files
  to be specified as an argument. However, if you do, citations will
  be constrained to those bib files.

* Support newlines/whitespace around cite keys when multiple keys are
  specified.
  Thanks to dizcza for help with testing.
  See issue #205 and pull request #206.

* Improve citation ordering code (reported by ukos-git, see issue
  #182).

* The unresolved citations across documents issue has been resolved.
  The extension stores all citation information in a ``bibtex.json`` file.
  If it does not exist, the file will be created on
  your first sphinx build, and you will have to rerun the build
  to make use of it. The file is automatically kept up to date,
  with a warning whenever you need to rerun the build.
  Thanks to dizcza for help with testing.
  See issues #197 and #204. Also see pull request #208.

* Migrate test suite to pytest, using sphinx's testing fixtures.

* **BACKWARD INCOMPATIBLE**
  The API has been refactored.
  Some functions have moved to different modules.
  Refer to the API documentation for details.

* Drop Python 3.5 support.

* Add Python 3.9 support.

1.0.0 (20 September 2019)

  support for these as well).

* Add Python 3.8 support (contributed by hroncok).

* Update for Sphinx 2.x, and drop Sphinx 1.x support (as there is too
  much difference between the two versions).

  contributed by chrisjsewell).

* Switch to codecov for coverage reporting.

0.4.2 (7 January 2018)
----------------------

* Drop Python 3.3 support, add Python 3.7 support.

  now supported by pybtex natively (see issue #127, reported by
  erosennin).

-------------------

* Document LaTeX workaround for ``:cite:`` in figure captions
  (contributed by xuhdev, see issue #92 and pull request #93).

0.3.1 (10 July 2014)
--------------------

* Fix for ``type_.lower()`` bug: pybtex 0.18 expects type to be a
  string (this fixes issue #68 reported by jluttine).

0.3.0 (4 May 2014)
------------------

* **BACKWARD INCOMPATIBLE**
  The alpha style is now default, so citations are labelled in a way
  that is more standard for Sphinx. To get the old behaviour back, add
  ``:style: plain`` to your bibliography directives.

* **BACKWARD INCOMPATIBLE**
  :meth:`~sphinxcontrib.bibtex.cache.Cache.is_cited` has been removed.
  Use :meth:`~sphinxcontrib.bibtex.cache.Cache.get_cited_docnames` instead,
  which will return an empty list for keys that are not cited.

* Improved support for local bibliographies (see issues #52, #62, and
  #63; test case provided by Boris Kheyfets):

  - New ``docname`` and ``docnames`` filter identifiers.

  - Filter expressions now also support set literals and the operators
    ``in``, ``not in``, ``&``, and ``|``.

  See documentation for details.

  #61, suggested by Boris Kheyfets).

  (specifically: no more nested ``<span>``\ s).

* Remove latex codec code, and rely on latexcodec package instead.

* :class:`FilterVisitor` has been removed from the public API.
  Use :meth:`~sphinxcontrib.bibtex.cache.Cache.get_bibliography_entries`
  instead.

* Fix upstream Sphinx bug concerning LaTeX citation hyperlinks
  (contributed by erikb85; see pull request #45).

* Fix most pylint warnings, refactor code.

  they are cited, instead of following the order in the bib file, to
  reflect more closely the way LaTeX handles unsorted styles
  (addresses issue #15).

* Skip citation label warnings on Sphinx [source] links (issue #17,
  contributed by Simon Clift).

0.2.5 (18 October 2012)
-----------------------

* Duplicate label detection (issue #14).

  multiple bibliographies with a numerical label style (addresses
  issue #14).

0.2.4 (24 August 2012)
----------------------

* New options for the bibliography directive for rendering the
  bibliography as bullet lists or enumerated lists: ``:list:``,
  ``:enumtype:``, and ``:start:``.

* Minor latex codec fixes.

* Turn exception into warning when a citation cannot be relabeled
  (fixes issue #2).

* Document LaTeX encoding, and how to turn it off (issue #4).

* Use pybtex labels (fixes issue #6 and issue #7).

* Cache tracked citation keys and labels, and bibliography enumeration
  counts (fixes issues with citations in repeated Sphinx runs).
