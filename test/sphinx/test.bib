	of control. Models of different complexity are presented, starting
	with simple ones and ending with more realistic models generated
	from multibody software. We consider models that capture essential
	behavior such as self-stabilization as well as models that demonstrate
	difficulties with rear wheel steering. We relate our experiences
	using bicycles in control education along with suggestions for fun
	and thought-provoking experiments with proven student attraction.
	Finally, we describe bicycles and clinical programs designed for
	children with disabilities.},

  review = {Shows a steer torque measurement system constructed for the UCSB instrumented

	They first show the point mass model like Karnopp's 2004 model (older
	ones are referenced in Meijaard2007). They stablize the steer angel
	to roll angle transfer function with a negative feedback gain which
	has dependence on the forward velocity.
	
	
	He adds a basic model of the front fork geometry to the point mass
	model, giving a relationship between steer torque input and steer
	angle which is speed dependent. The roll angle to steer angle now
	has a builtin negative feedback law due to the front fork geometry
	and if the k2 gain is large enough (with steer torque = 0) the system
	is stable. He uses this to calculat a critical velocity for stability.
	
	
	Klein says you should grip the handlebars lightly to take advantage
	of the bicycle self stability. This corresponds to the differences
	in the Whipple model and one with arms.
	
	
	Cites Wier1972 as giving 0.1s and 0.3s of nueromuscular delay in steer
	torque and upper body lean, respectively.
	
	
	The gyroscopic effects give rise to derivative feedback.
	
	
	Claims that riders use variation in forward speed as an additional
	control variable.},
